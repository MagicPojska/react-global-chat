# react-global-chat

<h1>Chat project</h1>

This is a project I made to learn using react, react hooks, material-ui and firebase. This is a one chat room where everyone, when they log in, can chat

I made this using:

- REACT.JS
- Firebase
- Material UI

You can see the and test the chat [here](https://react-global-chat.vercel.app/)
